            <br><br><br>Interpreting the score, by Stephen Wright
                <br><br>1‐2: Not happy. If you answered honestly and got a very low score, you’re
probably seeing yourself and your situation as worse than it really is.
<br><br>2‐3: Somewhat unhappy.
<br><br>3‐4: Not particularly happy or unhappy. A score of 3.5 would be an exact
numerical
average of happy and unhappy responses. Some of the exercises
mentioned just above have been tested in scientific studies and have been
shown to make people lastingly happier.
<br><br>4: Somewhat happy or moderately happy. Satisfied. This is what the
average person scores. <br><br>4‐5: Rather happy; pretty happy.
<br><br>5‐6: Very happy. Being happy has more benefits than just feeling good. It’s
correlated with benefits like health, better marriages, and attaining your
goals.
<br><br>6: Too happy. Yes, you read that right. Recent research seems to show that
there’s an optimal level of happiness for things like doing well at work or
school, or for being healthy, and that being “too happy” may be
associated with lower levels of such things.
