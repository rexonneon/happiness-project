    <div class="header">Oxford Happiness Questionnaire</div>
    <div class="start">
        <p><h4><br>The Oxford Happiness Questionnaire was developed by psychologists Michael Argyle and
                Peter Hills at Oxford University.
            <br><br>Instructions
                Below are a number of statements about happiness. Please indicate how much you agree or
                disagree with each by entering a number in the blank after each statement, according to the
            following scale:
            <br><br>1 = strongly disagree
            <br>2 = moderately disagree
            <br>3 = slightly disagree
            <br>4 = slightly agree
            <br>5 = moderately agree 
            <br> 6 = strongly agree
            <br><br>Please read the statements carefully, some of the questions are phrased positively and others
            negatively. Don’t take too long over individual questions; there are no “right” or “wrong”
            answers (and no trick questions). The first answer that comes into your head is probably the
            right one for you. If you find some of the questions difficult, please give the answer that is
            true for you in general or for most of the time.</p></h4>
